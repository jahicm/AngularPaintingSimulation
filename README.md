This project is a part of my certification work for Angular 17 and is just prototype with some important features. It is not meant to be used in PROD environment.

1. In order to call backend REST services from Angular front-end , it is important to install Mockoon (https://mockoon.com/).
JSon responses are added in the repository and need to be configured based on Mockoon's guideline. These are mocked API responses used to test Angular part only
and not the entire front-end back-end side.

2. Images can be listed and sorted and filtered based on criterias but also Angular Test Frameworks Karma and Jasmine are used (ng test command).

3. Off course Angular CLI must be installed (npm install ..) as for every Angualr project.
